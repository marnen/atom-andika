# Andika

This package makes it easier to use the lovely [Andika](https://software.sil.org/andika) font with Atom. Andika is a _proportionally spaced_ font developed by [SIL International](https://www.sil.org/), with a design that takes the needs of beginning readers into account by disambiguating similar letterforms. This also makes it nice for reading source code!
